              <dd>
                <p>Yes, Trafalgar online is a secured site. Users will be required as a one-time activity to register their credit card for payment. Credit card registration is required to improve the security of the site. Customers will experience greater
                  confidence as credit card registration conforms closely to financial guidelines. The registration process provides a reasonable guarantee that the individual executing the transaction is an authorized user of the credit card. Registration
                  requires an initial transaction in the currency of the card for a random amount between 1.00 and 2.00 in value. The cardholder must then get the amount charged to the card by contacting their financial institution. This amount is then
                  submitted in the confirmation phase of the card registration.</p>
